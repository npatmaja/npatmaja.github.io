      <title>Time to be a Programmer</title>

&lt;p&gt;Indonesian tech startups are gaining momentum in recent years as more VCs
are investing into local startups. Big names such as Sequoia Capital have entered the country by funding
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techinasia.com/tokopedia-softbank-sequoia-capital-funding-news#!&#34;&gt;Tokopedia (together with SoftBank)&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techinasia.com/indonesia-sequoia-go-jek&#34;&gt;Gojek&lt;/a&gt;.
Chinese VCs also getting more
active too. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techinasia.com/moxybilna-raises-15-million-is-now-called-orami&#34;&gt;Gobi partners latest investment on Oramy (former MoxyBilna)&lt;/a&gt;
is a proof to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it means they pursue growth more than ever. To sustain the required growth
rate, they need to grow as well, in term of size and organization. Hence, they need a lot of people to fill bunch of positions and software
developer/programmer are one
of the most highlighted one. Based on the insider rumours, some startups
even planning to double their engineering team in the near future to cope
with their growth.
Why? because they are &lt;em&gt;tech&lt;/em&gt; companies that
leverage technologies to solve costumers&amp;rsquo; problems and most of the used
technologies are computer-based software, which is relatively easier to scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being in high demand, programmers are scarcely available. Currently
we have under supply of programmers situation, at least based on my
observation and experience on seeking and interviewing programmers for
software developer role. So, it is a common sight when a startup hijacks
other startups&amp;rsquo; programmers to join the team, which also come with a
significant amount of compensation and additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, a computer-science-related graduate in Indonesia
would see telco,
banking and oil &amp;amp; gas industries as the top career paths to pursue to make
a good living. However, now there&amp;rsquo;s an alternative to those: startups.
An experienced programmer in a startup could earn relatively same
(or maybe even more) to those who work in those industries, especially
big name startups with lot of investment funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the wages, there are a lot of perks when working in a startup.
Dealing with new cool technologies is one of it. Personally this is the
very reason I decided to work in a startup a year ago. Being a programmer
in a corporate is very restraining, way too rigid. There are a lot of
efforts to put when wanting to implement new technologies, even more, most of the efforts are wasted to non-technical issues, bureaucracy. In contrast,
in startups programmers are always in search of new technologies available
to solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, startups culture is almost the opposite of corporates&amp;rsquo;,
more freedom and less bureaucracy. Usually startups have flatter
organizational structure. Which means it is easier to communicate to everyone
else including the CEO. This is particularly important during product development.
We don&amp;rsquo;t need to set an official meeting just to ask view questions to let&amp;rsquo;s say sales or operation team about our product, efficiency. For the freedom part, at the very least employees are
free to wear T-shirts to the office, some of them even work remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, most startups are merit base system, they see what we capable of instead of our formal education background or anything else. It means
everyone can be a programmer if s/he wants to. Being in high demand, it
is undeniably very good opportunities to anyone to enter the industry
as a programmer, given the aforementioned benefits. However, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know computer programming right now but aspire to be a
programmer in the future (or even just for fun), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.codecademy.com/&#34;&gt;Codeacademy&lt;/a&gt; could be a
good place to start, or if you want to be in an after work coding
class, you might want to check &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gepi.co/coding-class&#34;&gt;GEPI Coding Class&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, is this the right time to be a programmer in Indonesia?
yes it is, and always is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Learning to Code</title>

&lt;p&gt;My friend at office asked me recently &amp;ldquo;Can I learn to code by myself?&amp;rdquo;. You may have probably encountered
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/search?q=learn%20to%20code&#34;&gt;one or two posts that talk about it elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. And they point to the
same answer as mine: &amp;ldquo;yes you can&amp;rdquo;. As a background, I receive a formal education in Information System (which had less computer
science-related courses than computer science or informatics major) and it&amp;rsquo;s
past a decade when I wrote my first &lt;em&gt;Hello World!&lt;/em&gt; program during my first
semester at university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done programming over a decade now. Compared to a decade earlier, now
is relatively easier for someone to learn to code. A lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/&#34;&gt;web apps&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.codecademy.com/&#34;&gt;built for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.codeschool.com/&#34;&gt;this sole purpose&lt;/a&gt; available for either
free or paid by subscription. Moreover, a zillion of tutorials, discussion board and online classes are available
over the internet. However, even with aforementioned resources, learning to
code is still a formidable undertaking. Some will survive and not few won&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I code for living and done many years programming I find myself still
learning to program and to have better craftmanship on programming. I&amp;rsquo;ve been
through the phase from zero to able to write small-course-assignmet programs
to write bit more complex piece of software, and here&amp;rsquo;s some of my thoughts on learning to code based on those experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;perseverance-is-a-must:832af4bab778639ada7945e8314a1044&#34;&gt;Perseverance is a must&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to code can be fun at the beginning. Solving small problems keeps us
going. However, when we getting closer to real world problems, we might
stumble upon problems that are really hard to solve. We spend hours or even
days to work on it but to no avail. This is where perseverance play its part
&amp;mdash; to keep trying until the problem is solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;google-is-your-best-companion:832af4bab778639ada7945e8314a1044&#34;&gt;Google is your best companion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily Google, any search engine will do. In fact, I use
&lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com/&#34;&gt;duckduckgo&lt;/a&gt; most of the time. Believe me, we are not
the only one who have the unsolved problems. A lot of programmers are struggling with the same problems as well and most of the case they have already have the answers. Hence a skill to search on a search engine is a
necessity when programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;focus-don-t-get-distracted:832af4bab778639ada7945e8314a1044&#34;&gt;Focus, don&amp;rsquo;t get distracted&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, this one is rather hard for me, to focus on completing
one thing at a time. Programming could easily overwhelm someone as there
are a lot of information need to digest. Therefore, it is best to have a
plan when we learn programming of any new programming languages. Learn the
basic first, don&amp;rsquo;t be tempted to learn advance stuff at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;get-the-fundamentals:832af4bab778639ada7945e8314a1044&#34;&gt;Get the fundamentals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may said it is not really important, but the right data structure and algorithm can optimize a program by lot compared to not using any. Knowing fundamentals in computer science can be a clear separation between a bad programmer with a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;familiarize-with-well-written-projects:832af4bab778639ada7945e8314a1044&#34;&gt;Familiarize with well-written projects&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading and examining well-written open source projects help a lot to benchmark ourself with the best practice out there. We can learn how to properly structure our project, how to make proper comments,
and how to modularize the code. After a while we will find that our code written so far is just a pile of garbage compared to the project. However,
it is a necessary part of learning; we have to know our mistakes to make
improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;sectionsign&#34;
  style=&#34;
    margin:0 auto;
    margin-top: -1rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    text-align: center;
  &#34;
  &gt;
  &lt;span&gt;&amp;#8213; &amp;#167; &amp;#8213;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the end, I believe everyone can code but to be a better programmer requires
one step beyond that, with considerable amount of efforts. Me myself is still
in the middle of voyage to go there.&lt;/p&gt;
