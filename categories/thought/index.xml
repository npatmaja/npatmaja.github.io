      <description>Indonesian tech startups are gaining momentum in recent years as more VCs are investing into local startups. Big names such as Sequoia Capital have entered the country by funding Tokopedia (together with SoftBank) and Gojek. Chinese VCs also getting more active too. Gobi partners latest investment on Oramy (former MoxyBilna) is a proof to the statement.
Now, it means they pursue growth more than ever. To sustain the required growth rate, they need to grow as well, in term of size and organization.</description>

And they point to the same answer as mine: &amp;ldquo;yes you can&amp;rdquo;. As a background, I receive a formal education in Information System (which had less computer science-related courses than computer science or informatics major) and it&amp;rsquo;s past a decade when I wrote my first Hello World!</description>
