      <description>Vim or &amp;ldquo;Vi Improved&amp;rdquo; is a text editor that works in every terminal. Some people even consider Vim as the best text editor for programming. However, many people are also intimidated with its steep learning curve. Vim is a terminal-based text editor which means everything are operated through keyboard keys, there is no need to use the trackpad or mouse. This is actually what makes Vim powerful. One does not need to take their fingers off of the keyboard when writing in Vim.</description>

      <description>My friend at office asked me recently &amp;ldquo;Can I learn to code by myself?&amp;rdquo;. You may have probably encountered one or two posts that talk about it elsewhere. And they point to the same answer as mine: &amp;ldquo;yes you can&amp;rdquo;. As a background, I receive a formal education in Information System (which had less computer science-related courses than computer science or informatics major) and it&amp;rsquo;s past a decade when I wrote my first Hello World!</description>

      <description>As a someone who codes frequently, in daily basis in fact, I need an environment that is able to boost my productivity when coding. Some might argue that one could be productive in every given environment. That is the ideal case, however live is not. Hence, productivity tools and workflows are created.
During my coding adventure, I found some ways that help me to boost up my productivity, which are listed below.</description>

      <description>I am a noob in android development and one thing I am not comfortable with is the stock android device emulator. The default emulator is really slow, the boot-up process could take minutes in my machine (I won&amp;rsquo;t say my machine is fast either, but it is sufficient), the app deployment takes too much time, moreover, the interaction is sluggish. Hence, it is a no go.
Up to now, I used my own android phone to test my app.</description>

      <title>Rendering Backbone (Sub)View</title>

      <description>When learning backbone.js (i&amp;rsquo;m a novice by the way), at first, I was actually having a hard time to grasp the backbone view. Especially how the best practice to render the view and build a rather complex view consists of several subviews. And then, magically I came accross Ian Storm Taylor&amp;rsquo;s post about his experience on dealing with backbone subview. At first I didn&amp;rsquo;t quiet understand well about the post until I found a thread on stackoverflow, which was started by Ian Storm Taylor.</description>
