      <description>Several weeks ago, my Docpad installation got screwed. There was some errors when I tried to run it. My assumption was because I just moved to Node.js 5.x, so I tried to upgrade (or re-install it, maybe) it. Though the errors are gone, it did not work as it used to be, it failed to build my blog properly &amp;mdash; or I just forgotten how to use it, that&amp;rsquo;s another possibility.</description>

      <title>Rendering Mermaid in Docpad</title>

      <description>I stumbled across Mermaid when I saw @ronaldwidha retweeted a tweet about it. Mermaid is a library for writing diagrams instead of draw them similar to Marked to markdown, awesome! So, I thought I could use this in my blog just in case I need to draw some flowcharts or sequence diagrams in the future.
DocPad uses Marked to render markdown to html via docpad-plugin-marked but natively, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Mermaid syntax.</description>

      <description>It has been a long time since I planned to have a dedicated blog for writing about some more &amp;ldquo;meaningful&amp;rdquo; stuff instead of just my rumbling I posted on my trash bin. After looking out what blogging platforms available, I finally decided to use GitHub pages to host my posts. However, as it uses Jekyll as its engine, many people suggested to install Jekyll in my local machine, which was a no-show for me.</description>
