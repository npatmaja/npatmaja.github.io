      <description>Go(lang) is getting momentum in Indonesia during the recent years as big names are migrating to Go. Tokopedia, Go-Jek, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you both. Not to mention many other startups build their tech-stack using Go from the get-go due to the hype.
Go is an interesting programming language, not to mention it has fun part in it. It combines the ease of dynamically typed language and the efficiency of statically typed language with support for networked and multicore computing (Go FAQ page, 2017).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with functional JavaScript for a while, especially partial applications and function composition, and I find those concepts are very helpful in my daily coding practices. At first, if you are short in mathematical logic systems (just like me), making sense anything functional could be a bit out of hand. Fortunately there are a lot of reading materials that do a great job explaining the concepts in an easy and pragmatic way.</description>

      <description>Several weeks ago, my Docpad installation got screwed. There was some errors when I tried to run it. My assumption was because I just moved to Node.js 5.x, so I tried to upgrade (or re-install it, maybe) it. Though the errors are gone, it did not work as it used to be, it failed to build my blog properly &amp;mdash; or I just forgotten how to use it, that&amp;rsquo;s another possibility.</description>
