      <title>Android Development with Genymotion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a noob in android development and one thing I am not
comfortable with is the stock android device emulator.
The default emulator is really slow, the boot-up process could
take minutes in my machine (I won&amp;rsquo;t say my machine is fast either,
but it is sufficient), the app deployment takes too much time,
moreover, the interaction is sluggish. Hence, it is a no go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, I used my own android phone to test my app. It is fast,
quite responsive, but the downside is I need to connect my phone
to my laptop when I work on the app. Not to mention when I can&amp;rsquo;t find
my USB cable, disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://nauvalatmaja.com/img/genymotion.png&#34; alt=&#34;Genymotion in action&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is an alternative to android
stock emulator called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.genymotion.com&#34;&gt;Genymotion&lt;/a&gt;. It runs
on top of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.virtualbox.org&#34;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt;, in other words, each android
virtual device is an virtual machine in VirtualBox. To use Genymotion
I have to register in the first place (the free account is sufficient for me)
and then &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.genymotion.com/#!/developers/user-guide#installing-genymotion&#34;&gt;downloaded and installed the application&lt;/a&gt;.
Following that, I created a virtual device of my liking
in the Genymotion application.
As I use Eclipse Android Development Tools, I then installed
&lt;a href=&#34;http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/genymotion-plugin-eclipse&#34;&gt;eclipse plugin for Genymotion&lt;/a&gt;. A plugin for
Android Studio is also available in the Genymotion&amp;rsquo;s website. Restarted Eclipse and
all was ready. A note, you need to install VirtualBox to use Genymotion,
otherwise it will complain about can not starting virtualization or
something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was skeptical about this emulator but it turn out to be the
opposite. It runs flawlessly, it boots up very fast and very responsive, and at some
point it is even faster than my phone. More importantly, it consumes considerably less
CPU resources compared to the default emulator, impressive. In the conclusion, I recommend
this emulator for android development over the stock emulator. If you need to access
more features other than camera and GPS, you can always change to the subscribe
version.&lt;/p&gt;
