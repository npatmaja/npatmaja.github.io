      <description>When learning backbone.js (i&amp;rsquo;m a novice by the way), at first, I was actually having a hard time to grasp the backbone view. Especially how the best practice to render the view and build a rather complex view consists of several subviews. And then, magically I came accross Ian Storm Taylor&amp;rsquo;s post about his experience on dealing with backbone subview. At first I didn&amp;rsquo;t quiet understand well about the post until I found a thread on stackoverflow, which was started by Ian Storm Taylor.</description>
